# Neuron

## Introduction

Nowadays, deep learning have been successfully used in many research and application areas. Deep learning have renewed the state-of-art performance in many areas such as computer vision, speech recognition again and again. Here I will introduce the concepts of deep learning.

Deep learning is just neural network with very deep layers, the basic concept of neural network is neuron. Neuron is the basic cells consisting the neural system of human.

The figure below shows the morphology of a neuron (Figure download from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron)).
