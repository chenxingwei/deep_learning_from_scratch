# Neuron

## Introduction

Nowadays, deep learning have been successfully used in many research and application areas. Deep learning have renewed the state-of-art performance in many areas such as computer vision, speech recognition again and again. Here I will introduce the concepts of deep learning.

Deep learning is just neural network with very deep layers, the basic concept of neural network is neuron. Neuron is the basic cells consisting the neural system of human.

### Neuron Cell

The figure below shows the morphology of a neuron (Figure download from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron)).

Above figure contains only one neural cell, consisting with many structures, such as many short Dendrites, and one very long Axon. The long Axon can be very long, long as 1 meter.  Talk in simple, the neuron receive signals from the short Dendrites and transfer the signal through the Axon to other neurons. The signals the neuron received are transported from many other cells, with different amount of signal, and the other cell have different distance from current neuron, so the signals received can be different of each Dendrites, deciding by the signal itself (input) and the distance (weight).

### Neuron model in neural networks

Then we can simplify the neuron model as

From figure above, the Dendrites and Axon are represent with edges, transported signals and neurons are represent with nodes.

Generally, a single neuron in neural network contains input (Dendrites), output (Axon) and activation function. Activation function can be any function, but we always take non-linear, deriable functions as the neuron's activation function.

The weights and bias in the figures above are initial with random gaussian distributed values. With learning algorithms, these parameters can be updated to suitable values to train the model.

## Summary

This is easy. We introduced the neuron and basic neuron model generated from the intuitive from the biological neuron. Next we will introduce the single neuron models.
