# deep_learning_from_scratch

## Introduction

In this repository, I will gradually implement some freqently used deep learning algorithms from scratch, including alogrithms and applications. This would include both the intuitive of the algorithms, and the mathematics bebind. Just ignore the math part if it troubles you. 

This repository will using Python, not using machine learning or deep learning package such as sklearn, tensorflow etc. But instead we will use [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) to facilitate numerical computation. This repository will be written using English, if you find your English or my English to understand, please check the Chinese repository-[中文版](https://github.com/chenxingwei/deep_learning_from_scrach_Chinese/tree/master).
